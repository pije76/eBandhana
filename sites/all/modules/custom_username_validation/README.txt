Description
------------------
  A pattern can be provided to validate the username on registration/user edit by a regexp.
  Just copy module into you module folder and change settings here: admin/settings/custom_username_validation.
  For the pattern format, see PHP's preg_match().
  
  Please note that the configuration page has moved from the admin/settings to admin/user. Additionally, there is a new permission to check whether a group may edit the username pattern.
